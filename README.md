# BYO Bingo

It's Yule time, I'm bored, and I was up earlier than everyone else in the house, so I killed some time by throwing together a little BYO bingo game for fun.

### Tech

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS

### Use

- Fill up your bingo card (Perhaps with expected sights and sounds that typify your holiday season)
- The app will place your inputs in a random cell
- Mark your cells complete when appropriate
- Bask in self-satisfaction when you get a bingo

### Note

No need to keep it open; this app persists the state of your bingo board via your browser local storage
